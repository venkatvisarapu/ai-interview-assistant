## Core Features

This project successfully implements all the core requirements of the assignment:

*   **üìÑ Resume Upload & AI Parsing:** Candidates can upload their resume (PDF/DOCX). The AI extracts their name, email, phone number, and key technical skills.
*   **ü§ñ Smart Validation Chat:** If any contact information is missing, a chatbot prompts the candidate to provide it before the interview begins.
*   **üß† Dynamic AI Interview Flow:** The application uses the Groq AI API to dynamically generate a unique set of 6 technical questions for each candidate, tailored to the Full Stack role and the candidate's skills.
*   **‚è±Ô∏è Timed Questions:** The interview consists of 2 Easy (20s), 2 Medium (60s), and 2 Hard (120s) questions, each with its own timer. The system automatically moves on when time expires.
*   **üìä AI Evaluation & Scoring:** After the final question, the AI provides a detailed evaluation, a final weighted score (0-100), and a concise summary of the candidate's performance.
*   **üóÇÔ∏è Synced Interviewer Dashboard:** A second tab provides a dashboard view for the interviewer. It lists all completed candidates, showing their scores and summaries.
*   **üîç Search & Sort:** The dashboard includes functionality to search for candidates by name/email and sort them by score or name.
*   **üîÑ Local Data Persistence:** The entire application state, including candidate history and in-progress interviews, is saved locally in the browser using `redux-persist`. This ensures that all completed interviews are retained in the dashboard.
